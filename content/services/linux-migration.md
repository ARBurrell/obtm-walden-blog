> Aside from the obvious cost benefits of using free software, migrating to Linux can free you in many other ways. Assisting free software migration is a personal mission here at OBTM and all systems in our office run GNU/Linux based systems with proprietary operating systems virtualized.  We love this setup and want to spread it throughout the world.  Windows XP is so 2003!

### Important note for Windows XP users!
On 8 April 2014, Microsoft will end support for Windows XP and effectively force existing users of this operating system to either upgrade to another Microsoft Product or loose security support entirely.  There have been many reports in the media that cyber miscreants are currently holding back discovered software exploits until 8th April because they know that Microsoft will stop issuing security fixes for this product, giving them free reign.  Regardless, Windows XP will become a large security risk and users will become 'low hanging fruit' for many cyber attackers.
If you have an older system that you don't want to spend much money on yet want state of the art security, then now is the time to migrate that machine to a free Unix based operating system.

> OBTM is offering a special deal for customers coming from Windows XP.  We will look at your hardware requirements and choose you a custom Linux distribution that suits your needs, and install and configure the system entirely bespoke, for Â£50.00.  Institutions, schools & businesses please call to arrange a quotation and see below for further offered services.
