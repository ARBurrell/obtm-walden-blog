> _He're at OBTM I chose to offer this service to the public after one too many visits to popular retail stores and hearing the plethora of **BAD ADVICE** that is given out to those who come through the doors.
If you are tired of hearing 'Mega bits' get freely confused with 'Giga bytes'; you don't care about the difference and just want your devices to work then look no further._

We will come to your home or office and talk to you about your requirements and then inspect your existing set up (if any) and offer sound advice for improvements/ additions.  We will also measure for cables etc.

## Home networking guidance

The goal in computer networking is to connect multiple devices together so that they can exchange data.  On a physical level this is achieved using either cable media or wireless media (radio).  Thanks to the elegant design of computer networking these are completely interoperable with each other.

> OBTM can assess your current networking needs and choose the right elements to enhance your existing network based on your daily usage.  There are often times where we can suggest cost effective solutions and improvements that you may never have heard of.  For example HDMI to ethernet adaptors can extend your TV picture greatly.

In computer networking there is a fundamental architecture which is based on the concept of a stack of layers.  Think of a stack of pancakes :).  At the bottom is the physical layer and each layer on top adds a level of abstraction to the one below it.  This is a very elegant design because it allows you to change and swap out parts on higher layers without affecting lower layers, for instance if we were to change the protocols that the internet is operated on we wouldn't have to re-lay all our physical cables again.

> For you the consumer this means we can be forward looking and install equipment that will not be obsolete tomorrow.

### What do you gain from a Home Network?

We live in a digital age.  Mostly everything we can perceive as data coming into our house (except what comes through your letterbox) is digital and therefore benefits from the interconnectivity of computer networking.  This includes TV, radio, telephone and the usual things like internet and computer data.
Here is a list of things you can connect together.

 - **Internet** - Sharing internet connection with many devices in your house
 - **Telephone** - Converting analog phone calls to digital to send around your home network or back out to the internet for the purposes of very low cost international telephony or mobile.
 - **Computer Data** = Backups of your important data, synchronizing data between all your devices, creating automated internet (off-site) backups.
 - **Television & Home Entertainment** - i.e. Record TV to watch on your smart-phone, share your music across all of your devices, back up your DVDs so you can put them in the loft etc.
 -  **Printing** - Sharing your printer throughout the home to all your devices.
